# Agent Oriented Architecture

**Agent Oriented Architecture (AOA)** reimagines how AI systems are built — around *modular, self-contained Agentic Units (AUs)* that can be discovered, orchestrated, and continuously improved.

AOA emphasizes:
- **Intent-driven composition** rather than fixed pipelines  
- **Specialization through deployment context** rather than monolithic training  
- **Continuous learning loops** across model, data, and tooling  

AOA treats each AU as an intelligent service — containerized, measurable, and evolvable — just like microservices transformed software architecture.
